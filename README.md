## Installation

You will need to install the "Inquirer package".
In VS Code, open the Terminal. 
Tab to the correct folder where the index.js file is located. 
On the command line, type the folling command:

npm i 

Then, the application will be invoked by using the following command:

node index.js

## Usage

After invoking the application, you will be asked to respond to a serious of prompts. (Please see the video link under Visuals to see a detailed walkthrough of this application.)
When you enter a project title, this will be displayed as the title of the README. When entering a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information will be added to their relative sections of the README. When you choose a license for your application from a list of options
then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. When you enter your GitHub username, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to your GitHub profile. When you enter your email address
this will also be added to the Questions section, with instructions on how to reach you. 
Once all prompts are completed, a README.md file will be generated that matches your user input. This README will have a functioning table of contents that will have links corresponding to their relative sections.
